# Road Accident Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform safety measures and policymaking. The dataset includes details about accidents, their locations, times, causes, and other relevant factors.

## Features of the Repository
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Steps to prepare raw data for analysis, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the dataset's structure and key trends.
3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Metrics to assess the severity and frequency of road accidents.
4. **Interactive Dashboard:** An Excel-based dashboard summarizing key insights for stakeholders.

- **Trend Analysis:** Monthly/yearly trend of road accidents.
- **Location Hotspots:** Areas with the highest frequency of accidents.
- **Cause Distribution:** Proportions of different causes of accidents.
- **Severity Analysis:** Severity distribution across various categories.

## Technologies Used
- **Tools:** Microsoft Excel
